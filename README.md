## Penrose triangle rendered with Three.js and WebGL.

You can switch between perspective and orthographic cameras by double clicking or by pressing `enter`. 

When the orthographic camera is used, clicking the canvas or pressing `space` rotates the camera by 90 making it seem like the triangle is tilting. 

When the perspective camera is used, the camera can be repositioned by clicking and dragging the mouse,

The technique was inspired from https://codepen.io/Mamboleoo/pen/oepmBM but the implementation was done from 'scratch'. This was the first time I used three.js, I modified the code sample in the [BoxGeometry documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) to get started.
